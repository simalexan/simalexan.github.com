The bot publisher means the entity making the bot available to you, [as identified in the Bot Profile].

  IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO AND MUST NOT USE THE BOT.

  By accepting these terms, you represent that you are at least 18 years old or have reached the age of majority where you live, if that is more than 18 years of age. If you are under 18 or have not reached such age of majority, your parent or legal guardian must accept these terms on your behalf.

  APPLICABLE LAW.

  United States and Canada. If you acquired the bot in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern the interpretation of these terms, claims for breach of them, and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of law principles.

  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The bot and the service accessed via the bot are provided “as is” “with all faults” and “as available”. You bear the risk as to its quality and performance. The bot publisher gives no express warranties, guarantees, or conditions in relation to the bot. To the extent permitted under your local laws, Bot publisher excludes any implied warranties or conditions, including those of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

  LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. To the extent not prohibited by law, if you have any basis for recovering damages, you can recover from the bot publisher only direct damages up to the amount you paid for the bot or USD$1.00, whichever is greater. You will not, and waive any right to, seek to recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages from the bot publisher.

  This remedy doesn’t fully compensate you for any losses; or

  The bot publisher knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.
